# Indian-Currency-Notes-Classifier
This project is to build a machine learning model with the Indian currency dataset using convoluted neural network(CNN) algorithm and TensorFlow and keras library with which the machine model can identify the denomination of any Indian currency provided to it by using Python, Jupyter Notebook, OpenCV TensorFlow
